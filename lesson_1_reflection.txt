How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

i could compare both files' lines and could make out the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

i think having history of file can help compare btwn various versions and hence easily find bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

manual pros are we every version makes sense and is useful.
cons are human error of calling commit can lead to making too many changes to the file 
automatic has vice versa

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

becoz of data issue? may be they r bothered about generating huge data

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives the commits and their messages. then using git diff btwn the commit u want and the previous one, u can find the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

we can change the code freely and still revert back to older ones if something fails.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

now that i have git, i want to use it for writing efficient coding with easy bug finding tools
